# Portfolio Submission - CS 320 Software test, Automation QA Course
## Overview
This repository contains artifacts from my coursework in the CS XXX course, specifically focusing on software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The submitted files are from Project One and Project Two and showcase my ability to create and execute unit tests, analyze software testing approaches, and apply appropriate testing strategies based on requirements. These artifacts are an essential part of my portfolio, which I will continue to build throughout the computer science program.

## Project Artifacts
### Project One
Contact.java
ContactService.java
ContactTest.java
ContactServiceTest.java
These files demonstrate my ability to create and manage unit tests, ensuring that the software meets its functional requirements. The Contact and ContactService classes handle core functionalities, while the accompanying test classes verify the correctness and robustness of these implementations.

### Project Two
Summary and Reflections Report
This report reflects on the testing strategies employed in Project One and provides insights into the lessons learned during the project. It highlights my approach to software testing and the importance of adhering to quality assurance practices.

## Reflection
Ensuring Functional and Secure Code
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I follow a rigorous process of unit testing, code review, and continuous integration. By writing comprehensive tests that cover various edge cases, I can identify potential issues early in the development process. Additionally, I incorporate security best practices, such as input validation and secure data handling, to protect the software from vulnerabilities.

## Interpreting User Needs
Interpreting user needs is a critical part of software development. I approach this by closely analyzing the project requirements, asking clarifying questions when necessary, and considering the end-user experience. By focusing on usability and functionality, I can design software that not only meets but exceeds user expectations.

## Designing Software
My approach to designing software begins with understanding the problem domain and defining clear requirements. I then create a modular and scalable architecture that allows for future enhancements and easy maintenance. Throughout the design process, I emphasize simplicity and efficiency, ensuring that the final product is both effective and user-friendly.

## Conclusion
This submission is a reflection of my ongoing learning and development in the field of computer science. By continually refining my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance, I am preparing myself for future challenges and opportunities in the industry.
